//Problem 1.	Declare Variables

//Declare five variables choosing for each of them the most appropriate of the types
//byte, sbyte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, ulong to represent the following 
//values: 52130, -115, 4825932, 97, -10000. Choose a large enough type for each number to ensure it 
//will fit in it. Try to compile the code. Submit the source code of your 
//Visual Studio project as part of your homework submission.
